        <div class="subheading mb-5">Chemistry Major ðŸ“™</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">	As an avid student in the University of California Riverside, my drive for learning travels 
        back to my passion for analytical chemistry and observing the structure of chemical substances. I believe that UCR
        is the ideal place to hone my knowledge of natural matter and its involvement in the world; Riversideâ€™s global 
        diversity and plentitude of research opportunities will only further my interest for being a chemistry major, and 
        expand my possibilities for future careers. My foundation for doing research begins with having been exposed to 
        multiple research volunteering events prior to attending UCR.

<br><br>

          My involvement with these events include participating in several plant reservation sites in San Francisco (2019) 
          and analyzing the structure of plants, thus enhancing my skills in examination and inquiry. I gather that these 
          first steps of research will reinforce my ability to do even better analysis in applying more skills to chemistry 
          experiments. In addition to my inclusion in examining the structure of plants, I have brought forth soft skills 
          that may be sought out in the workspace for future careersâ€”by means of completing my fair share of work at my l
          ocal Walgreens (2019). As a sales associate, I learned how to work and learn from my co-workers, as well as adapt 
          to the unpredictability of customers or any certain situation on a given day. My experience in Walgreens has molded 
          me to become a mature adult and thrive under pressure, which I am sure will be the same conditions when I am 
          expected to put out one hundred and ten percent of my effort into ensuing jobs regarding analytical chemistry.

<br><br>

          My journey as a chemistry major in the University of California Riverside surely will be one that is full of new 
          experiences for me to discover. Not only do I plan on pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree within four years, but I also 
          plan to enter graduate school in hopes of entailing a career in analytical chemistry. My path in UCR, however, will 
          only begin if I set particular goals for myself to be challenged with. Among these goals, I aim to create a better 
          sense of social networking through a series of clubs or social outings. For one, I want to keep in touch with my 
          Filipino culture by learning from my peers in the Katipunan organization club, which will ultimately strengthen my 
          ethnic awareness of my culture and others around me in the workspace. 

<br><br>

          Furthermore, I would like to associate myself with people with different skill sets in comparison to mine; whether 
          it be through distinct classes, or clubs that can offer a specific trade of expertise, I will make it my duty to 
          learn as much as possible besides only chemistry. Specifically, I want to be more involved with a subject like data 
          science, which is highly applicable to the modernized world to this day. While I am familiar with HTML, javascript, 
          and other computer dexterity, I know that there is plenty more room to gain an understanding of the programming world. 
          Once these goals are accomplished and accounted for, it will only make it easier for me to be a utility man in 
          future careers, as I will be able to offer more than just one profession. Fortunately, I am eager to pursue additional 
          internships and research opportunities, as I find myself to be thrilled by the incorporating old and new skills together, 
          to ultimately become the most productive member in the workspace.
